# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## General Backend Information
There is one main table for sighting entry that the users should input and two other tables for data management, the location table and the appearance table. The two other tables are purely in there just to ensure consistency across entries; location would be consistent with respect to the buildings that the sightings were close to and squirrel appearance would be uniform amongst the color keys.

## Repository Report
As our partners were ourselves, we are using our own backend.

## Evaluation Questionnaire
OS we are running the project on: Windows 10, Linux, macOS.

## Project Repository:
README present on GitHub.
Changelog in the form of commit messages.
Instructions present on README and Bash script.
Description of PostgreSQL presented in presentation and installation instructions in bash script.
Utilizing proper naming conventions and best practices.
General comments on functionality of class/function/block exists in most of the files save for the extra java file. Input and Output mainly present in dbpopulate file and build file.
Uniform indentation, across a single file. Comments and variable names are sensible.
Test CSV files are placed as input files for running the functions.
Test CSV file has adequate input information.

## Software Design Evaluation:
Purpose of the project given in README and presentation. This project is build dependencies for the squirrel database and create API endpoints for said database.
Not present.
Project is to be forked from the repository onto oneâ€™s device and build.sh is to be run. Follow instructions for installation of dependencies in build.sh and the script will set up the database and API endpoints.

## Software Implementation Evaluation:
The instruction leads to running the build.sh file for installation and setup.
The build.sh file describes what steps to take next.
Instructions given by build.sh more or less explain what needs to be installed and where for each type of OS. Missing information: how to set up PostgreSQL in the PATH environment.
This project states to install Node, NPM and PostgreSQL for it to work.
Had to install Node, NPM and PostgreSQL by following the instructions given by the build.sh script.
To run the program provided, build.sh had to be run via terminal or CMD for Windows which came with macOS/linux and Windows respectively. Further dependencies such as Node, NPM and PostgreSQL installations were needed which there were instructions given for.
